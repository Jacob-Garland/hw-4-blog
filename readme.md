# Wk 4 Homework

## Description

For the course, week four's challenge provided starter code for a blog containing mostly CSS stylesheets. Landing page and blog page needed code for their bodies.
As well as three Javascript files needing code to add functionality and interactivity to the blog page for users. I coded these in to provide the website deployed 
from this repository.
